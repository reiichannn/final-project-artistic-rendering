    <h2 align="middle" class="title" style="color: #8c7877;">Technical Overview</h2>

    <p class="body">

      Our project is based on the framework set by “A Framework for Digital Watercolor” by P. Brien[2], where we divide
      the watercolor simulation into four parts: the brush, the fluid (water) simulation, the pigment flow (model of
      paper), and color calculation. The brush is implemented as a simple discrete sampling of a circle, in which the
      pixels covered by the circle receives pigment depending on how fast the brush is moving. The water simulation is
      handled by using the modified LBM equations given below[1].
    </p>

    <figcaption align="middle">The Lattice Boltzman Equation</figcaption>

    <p class="body">
      The main difference to the original LBM’s stream & collide equation is the addition of partial bounce-back during
      streaming, even when no boundary cells are involved. This is done by introducing a blocking factor at each cell’s
      distribution functions, which then work to simulate the streaming step being “partially pushed back”. This is done
      to simulate back-runs and granulation that is characteristic to realistic watercolor movement. After the water
      flow has been simulated, we also have to simulate the actual pigment flow to achieve correct reflectance at
      different sites. We do this by modeling the paper as 3 layers: the surface layer, the flow layer, and the fixture
      later. The key idea is that the pigment will flow spatially across cells, as well as flow into different layers of
      the paper at each cell, dependent on the water distribution functions. After the pigment flow is handled, we
      calculate the reflectance of each cell using the Kubelka-Munk model. The KM model allows us to composite multiple
      layers of pigment (or color) in the same cell to create a realistic looking color for the overlapping watercolor.

      Although the main framework of the project is still relatively same as that of Patrick O’ Brien’s, the our methods
      in executing some of the four main steps in the algorithm differ substantially in some cases. The main reason for
      the differences was mostly due the insufficient explanations in our reference[2] or the ineffectiveness of the
      methods described. The details on the differences in some steps of the watercolor simulation is given in the next
      section.

    </p>
    <h2 align="middle" class="title" style="color: #8c7877;">Our modifications</h2>

    <p class="body">
      The first major area in which our implementation differed from either paper was pigment_Pf.glsl, which handled the
      deposition of pigment from the surface layer to the flow layer. This was done because the papers’ method was not
      reliably transferring the pigment, and would often leave pigment stranded in the surface layer even after no water
      remained to transport it. Additionally, we wrote the rest of the code assuming pigment data was in terms of
      absolute quantity, but it could have been the case that the papers assumed the storage of concentration per unit
      of water. To fix these issues, we did a slightly simpler formula for computing pigment transfer. Given the
      fraction of water flowing out of the surface and into the flow layer, we would transfer the same fraction of
      pigment into the pigment’s flow layer. This made pigment transfer very simple and reliable. An additional change
      made was having a small minimum amount of pigment transferred even in the case of no water flow, but as long as
      the cell had density and there was pigment to transfer. This was done specifically to counter cases where a cell
      was saturated with water (as determined by Beta) but had no pigment and therefore could not receive any pigment
      from the surface layer.
      A second significant difference from the papers was the handling of the blocking factor. Supposedly, the blocking
      factor is set to the height field of the cell for non-pinned cells. However, we found that the results looked much
      better if the blocking factors were all kept much lower. To that end, we reduced all blocking factors by a factor
      of 60, which was arrived at through experimentation.
      The last area that our code could be very different from the ideal model is the brush handling. The papers hardly
      go into any detail about their implementation, save for using a circular brush and considering pixels fully inside
      to be under the brush. After trying many methods and refining each iteration, we arrived at a rather complicated
      shader for the brush. First, it takes the line segment of the current mouse position and the previous mouse
      position and considers any cell within a threshold distance to be under the brush. This creates a smoother brush
      and reduces noticeable sampling artifacts. Then, we compute a scaled brush direction, which influences which
      distribution functions to increase more. The greater the magnitude of the brush vector, the more we increase the
      corresponding distribution functions. However, no matter the brush vector, we define a minimum amount to increase
      the distributions by to effect more visible flow in the end result. The surface pigment and water are both
      increased, with a slight exponential falloff towards the extremities of the brush. A key implementation detail is
      that none of the values altered by the brush shader are plainly increased. Instead, they are “averaged up” to a
      certain maximum. This makes the brush application look more even, and eliminates issues with large distribution
      function values becoming unstable.

      Various minor edits we made include clamping of values to either ensure they remained non-negative, to ensure they
      did not grow too large, or to ensure that a minimum value was used. The last two especially are prevalent
      throughout all the shaders, as a way of controlling values to be within expectations. For example, the pigment
      deposited onto the fixture layer is clamped to be between 0.003 and less than a percent (depending on various
      factors) of the total pigment in the flow layer.

      Debugging was extremely tedious for this project. Not only are all the shaders interdependent, it is very hard to
      verify intermediate results as our only output is the rendered outcome of the entire pipeline. As a result, trying
      to pin down the cause of a bug involved lots of manual perturbation to try setting some values to constants,
      commenting out different blocks of code, writing simplified shaders with easily verifiable behavior to test the
      other shaders, etc. Essentially, it was one big game of guess and check. Furthermore, the compiler gave very vague
      error messages, so even syntax errors could take a few minutes to find and solve. Lastly, sometimes we would find
      out that a parameter was off by an order of magnitude or more the entire time, and once we fixed it, things would
      work but we would need to adjust nearly a dozen other parameters to complement the new value. Adjusting the
      parameters was especially challenging, as small changes to one of the parameters or the code could warrant hours
      of testing combinations of the other parameters.

      We learned that it is not always the case that some complicated method in a paper is correct or that it will
      produce the best visual results (especially when there are more than 5 hyper parameters involved). In fact, better
      results in computer graphics can sometimes be achieved by taking shortcuts behind the scenes rather than staying
      true to the mathematics.

      Here we showcase some of the results obtained from our application. Some of the notable characteristics of
      watercolor are shown, such as the way the colors mix, edge darkening, back-runs, and granulation.
